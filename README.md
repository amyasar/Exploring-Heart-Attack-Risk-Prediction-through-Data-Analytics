**Exploring Heart Attack Risk Prediction through Data Analytics**

In my latest project, I conducted an in-depth analysis of a dataset to understand the risk factors associated with heart attacks. Here are the key components and achievements of my work:

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Managed missing values, split complex columns such as 'Blood Pressure' into 'Systolic' and 'Diastolic', and transformed categorical variables for analytical readiness.

- Data Exploration and Visualization: Employed statistical plots to uncover distributions and correlations between health metrics and heart attack risk, gaining valuable insights on the influence of factors like BMI, diabetes, and family history.

- Advanced Analytical Modeling: Developed a logistic regression model adjusted for class imbalance to predict heart attack risk. The project highlighted the challenges and sensitivities of predictive modeling in medical data analysis.

- Insights and Future Directions: Identified critical predictors of heart attack risk and outlined recommendations for employing more sophisticated models to enhance predictive accuracy, particularly in dealing with imbalanced data.

This project not only enhanced my skills in data science and analytics but also underscored the potential of predictive modeling in improving health outcomes. Check out my full report for a deeper dive into the methodology and findings!
